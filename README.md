# Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.

This repo contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures, primarily written in C++ and Ruby.

## Coding Interview Questions

This repo also contains solutions for coding interview questions, mostly written in Java. Most of these questions were taken from the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). Some were based on real interview questions.

Questions from the book can be found in [coding-interview-book](./coding-interview-book). Real interview questions can be found in [real-interviews](./real-interviews).

## Partial Persistence

The code under [partial-persistence](./partial-persistence) is based on lectures from MIT's [Advanced Data Structures](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring14/lectures/) course, delivered by Prof. Erik Demaine.

## ACM Coding Challenges

Solutions for the 2007 ACM Coding Challenges can be found in [acm/2007](../acm/2007).

## Miscellaneous

Some of these are just my own random experiments, e.g:

* [Hash Tables](./hash-tables)
* [Heaps](./heaps)
