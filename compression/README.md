# Compression

This directory contains implementations of algorithms relating to compression.

## Build

To build the code in this directory, just run `make`.

A series of small tests can be run with `make test`.

## Huffman Coding

The first of these is Huffman Coding, an algorithm for generating a [prefix code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code) that can then be used to compress a file.

My approach was informed by the compression lecture (Lecture 13) from the MIT Advanced Data Structures course, [Spring 2003](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.897/spring03/scribe_notes). The PDF has been included in this directory [here](./lecture13.pdf).

Compression:

    ./HuffmanCompress <input-file> <output-file>

Decompression:

    ./HuffmanDecompress <input-file> <output-file>

Both progress output some basic diagnostic information. More information can be generated by uncommenting the following line in either `.cpp` file:

```
//#define TRACE
```
