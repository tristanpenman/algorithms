# Intro to Algorithms

Algorithms based on pseudocode from the book Introduction to Algorithms (aka CLRS).

## Max Subarray

Given an array of integers, find a subarray that when summed, has the greatest sum of all possible subarrays:

    make
    ./MaxSubarray 3 4 1 -4 3 -3

### Expected Output

    $ ./MaxSubarray 3 4 1 -4 3 -3
    Looking for greatest subarray in:
      3 4 1 -4 3 -3
    Greatest subarray:
      3 4 1

There should be many more examples here, as I completed serveral exercises from the book. However they were all written in Jupyter notebooks, and can be found in my [cs-notebooks](https://github.com/tristanpenman/cs-notebooks/tree/master/intro-to-algorithms) repo.
