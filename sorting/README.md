# Sorting

Experiments and algorithms related to sorting.

## Quicksort

Our old favourite Quicksort. This is a fairly simple header-only quicksort implementation. A simple test program is included:

    make
    ./Quicksort

## Closest Pairs

This example shows how the Quicksort algorithm can be used as a primitive for constructing more sophisticated algorithms. This program takes a list of 2D points, and finds the closest pair:

    make
    ./ClosestPair
